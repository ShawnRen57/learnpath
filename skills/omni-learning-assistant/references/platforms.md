## Approved-plan scheduling handoff

After approval, use the current host's native automation tools. Verify the saved job ID, local time, IANA timezone and next execution; record the ID with `schedule-record`. The job should name this skill and the absolute course directory. Do not assume earlier chat context is available.

For Codex, use the automation tool available in the current client. For WorkBuddy, use its native Automation feature. For OpenClaw and Doubao work mode, inspect the actual native scheduling interface. If no scheduler is available, offer manual continuation.

DSH's Host Schedule provides create/list/update/delete in supported presets. Use a daily local-time rule with an explicit zone rather than a fixed 86400-second interval. The Host must run for execution. Native pause is unavailable in the documented upstream: pause course state immediately; do not report a host pause that did not occur. Deletion also removes host delivery history, so preserve relevant records and explain the impact before an authorized deletion.

## Native task instruction

“Use omni-learning-assistant at INSTALLED_SKILL_PATH to continue COURSE_ABSOLUTE_PATH. Read config, approved plan, state and recent lessons; run next. Respect pause/completion/daily limit. Reuse pending artifacts. For a new lesson, research actual sources, author within the time budget, include an explanatory figure and >=5 expansion links, compile and inspect the PDF, then deliver. Record delivery only after confirmation. Remain quiet on repeats. When complete, stop the recorded task and verify.”

Check the host receipt separately from the Skill's document and delivery state. A reminder receipt alone does not establish PDF completion. Runtime handoff guidance is part of normal usage; the host scheduler itself is outside this Skill's test scope.
